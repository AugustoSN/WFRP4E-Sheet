I'm making this sheet to help me with my dming in the TTRPG Warhammer Fantasy RolePlay 4th Edition.
This is not a complete work, and i won't post when completed since i don't own the rights to this game. This is purely to help with some issue i'm having maging this tool.
This is being created for personal use only, pratice of conding and game making in godot, and fun
